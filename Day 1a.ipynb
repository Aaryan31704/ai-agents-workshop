      "*   **Technical Regulations:** This season is the last to use the current power unit configuration introduced in 2014, and also the final year for the ground-effect car generation and the Drag Reduction System (DRS). New regulations are set to be introduced in 2026.\n",
      "*   **Driver Market:** There have been several significant driver movements, including Sergio Pérez leaving Red Bull Racing and new drivers like Gabriel Bortoleto joining the grid.\n",
